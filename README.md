## Ubuntu (Splunk + REMNux)

I started installing Ubuntu and named it after the latest version along with it is a clean slate. This will be the core of the isolation and I will install on top of the Ubuntu image an instance of Splunk for log arregation and analysis.

Similarily to this process, I am going to utilize another Ubuntu VM (full clone) to setup a Reverse Engineering Malware Analysis image using REMNux.

Before getting started, update and upgrade the Ubuntu machine: 

<pre>sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade</pre>

## Splunk

I went to the official Splunk website and selected the Free Trials & Downloads page. As I am there, I went ahead and selected the Splunk Enterprise trial. I filled out the required information and moved the splunk compressed debian package to /opt directory.

<pre>mv splunk (version-os-architecture-package) /opt/</pre>

I selected the splunk compressed debian package on the /opt directory and initiate the installation.

To start Splunk,

<pre>sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license</pre>


As I started this, I went to my localhost of Splunk Enterprise:

From there, I will be heading to the GitHub repository to get sample data from Splunk BOSS of the SOC version 3.



## REMNux


## Windows 11 (Cloudflare Flare VM)

I will be setting up a Windows 11 VM to create a Forensics Reverse Engineering toolkit such as Flare VM.
